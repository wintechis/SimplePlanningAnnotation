# Ontologie for Simple Planning Annotation
The ontology can be found  [here](https://paul.ti.rw.fau.de/~jo00defe/voc/spa). The server uses content negotiation and serves both the turtle file and a human-readable HTML file.

### Purpose and scope of the ontology
The Simple Planning Annotation (spa) ontologys purpose is to model preconditions and effects of interaction affordances in a W3C Web of Things Thing Description. 
The additional annotations allow the modeling of order of interaktios in Thing Descriptions. 

### Thing Description to Planning Problem
The annotations allow a mapping between Thing Descriptions and the Planning Domain Definition Language, enabling the use of standard AI planning algorithms to solve the created planning problem and automatically create a Web of Things program. 
A prototypical implementation that translates Thing Descriptions into planning problems can be found [here](https://github.com/FreuMi/TD2P).
